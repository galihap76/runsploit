# Runsploit
Runsploit is tool reverse shell on python i build this tool for myself you know you can fork this repository for contributor and i will accept if suitable for this project.
You can modify my source code if you want because my source code is open source and i keep build this tool runsploit.

# Need Ngrok
You need use ngrok for this because ngrok is a cross-platform application that exposes local server ports to the Internet learn more <a href="https://ngrok.com/">here</a>.
